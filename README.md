# Software Engineering Course Final Project

This repository contains the final project developed as part of a
**Software Engineering course** during the previous semester.

The project was completed to satisfy course requirements, including
requirements analysis, design documentation, implementation, testing,
and deployment considerations.

---

## Course Context

- Academic course: Software Engineering
- Project type: Team-based semester project
- Status: Completed and graded
- Maintenance: No longer actively maintained

This repository is preserved for academic record and evaluation purposes.

---

## Project Overview

The project implements a full-stack software system with clearly defined
functional and non-functional requirements. Emphasis was placed on:

- Requirement engineering (SRS, SAD)
- System design and architecture
- Implementation of backend and frontend components
- Testing, validation, and acceptance criteria
- Documentation and operational planning

---

## Repository Structure

- `backend/` — backend application logic
- `frontend/` — frontend application
- `docs/` and root markdown files — requirements, design, and compliance documents
- `run.py` — entry point for execution
- `.docx` files — formal course submissions (SRS, SAD, design, test plans)

---

## Documentation Included

This repository contains extensive course-mandated documentation, including:

- Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
- Software Architecture and Design (SAD)
- Design documents
- Test plans and acceptance criteria
- Operational and compliance documentation

These documents reflect academic requirements rather than production standards.

## Contributors

This project was developed collaboratively as part of a course requirement.

## Disclaimer

This is a **course project repository**.  
It does not represent an actively developed personal or research project,
and the design choices reflect academic constraints and learning objectives
rather than long-term maintainability or research goals.
